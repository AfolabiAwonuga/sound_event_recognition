# Sound Event Recognition 

This repository explores the use of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) as the primary techniques for constructing a classifier capable of identifying various sounds in a domestic environment.

## Data Collection 
A [dataset](https://github.com/AfolabiAwonuga/sound_event_recognition/tree/main/combi_set) of domestic environmental sounds was compiled utilizing a combination of publicly accessible datasets, specifically [ESC-50](https://github.com/karolpiczak/ESC-50#download), [UrbanSound8K](https://urbansounddataset.weebly.com/urbansound8k.html), and [Nigens](https://zenodo.org/record/2535878#.Y9WUii2cZyd).
